== Overview

I need to think a lot more about how types are applied, but overall it should be relatively straight forward.
I've been writing down inference rules (and I wish there was something that would compile inference rules into
a parser and type checker!).

G |- e1:T1 G |- cnd[n]:T1 G |- guard[n]:bool G |- r[n]:T2
=========================================================
case e1
    | cnd[n] (guard[n]) { r[n] }
    | _ { r[else] }

The algorithm here is relatively simple:

. collect together all types into their buckets, like `cnd` and `guard`
. make sure they all match

The idea for functions could be interesting as well, since we can have a `declaration` for a function
as well as various types of parameters... we need to make sure that the last member of the body matches
the type of the declaration or definition...
